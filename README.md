Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard

Project Title:
Air Quality Monitoring Dashboard – India

Air Quality Report – A comprehensive overview of pollutant levels and AQI trends across Indian cities.

Purpose:
This Power BI dashboard delivers a dynamic and interactive view of air quality data across major Indian cities. It helps stakeholders:
* Understand the severity and spread of pollution
* Identify pollution hotspots and cleaner cities
* Analyze AQI trends over time
* Visualize AQI distribution geographically via map integration

Problem Statement:
Air pollution in India poses significant health and environmental risks. Informed policymaking and public awareness require clear, data-driven insights into where pollution is most severe, which pollutants are prevalent, and how conditions are evolving.

Goals of the Dashboard:

* Visualize city-wise AQI performance
* Monitor key air pollutants
* Enable data filtering by city
* Highlight temporal trends and regional disparities
* Support environmental planning and awareness initiatives

Key Features & Visuals:

KPI Cards (Pollutant Averages)

* NO: 17.57
* PM2.5: 67.45
* CO: 2.25
* SO₂: 14.53

Top 3 Polluted Cities:

* Ahmedabad (452.12 AQI)
* Delhi (259.49 AQI)
* Patna (240.78 AQI)

Least Polluted Cities:

* Coimbatore (73.02 AQI)
* Shillong (53.80 AQI)
* Aizawl (34.77 AQI)

AQI Trend Line (2015–2020):
 Shows a declining AQI trend, suggesting improvement in some areas.
  
Area-wise AQI Map:
* Interactive map showing geographical AQI distribution for major cities.

 City Filter:
* Enables drill-down analysis for individual cities.

Key Insights:

* Ahmedabad has the highest AQI and requires urgent attention.
* Aizawl and Shillong showcase consistently clean air.
* Overall AQI is declining, suggesting positive progress.
* PM2.5 is the most prevalent and harmful pollutant.


Tech Stack:

* Power BI: Visuals and dashboard interactivity
* DAX / Power Query: Data modeling & transformation
* Microsoft Bing Maps: Geographic visualizations
